## Fifth Year Computer Science Final Project at ORT High School

This project was developed as part of the fifth-year final project in Computer Science at ORT Institute. It was created by a group of three: Sim√≥n Pedro Mirleni, Tobias Elkowich, and Damian Orzejovsky. It lasted the entire year, with partial deliveries of the group's progress made once every two weeks.

## Project Description

Another Cooking Simulator is a unique experience where virtual reality and multiplayer gaming merge to offer a fully immersive culinary experience. Players in virtual reality take on the exciting role of virtual chefs, while PC players form the team of waiters responsible for efficiently serving customers.

- **Virtual Reality Chef:** Players in virtual reality become master chefs. Using virtual hands, they'll be able to chop ingredients, grill burgers, assemble ingredients, and prepare delicious burgers following the waiters' orders.

- **PC Waiters:** PC players are the waiters who keep the operation moving. They'll take customers' orders, select the necessary ingredients from the pantry, and bring them to the virtual reality chef. Once the burgers are ready, they'll pick up the trays, add sides, and serve the meals to hungry customers.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Virtual Reality Experience:** Virtual reality technology allows VR players to interact with ingredients and kitchen utensils realistically, creating an authentic and immersive experience.

- **Essential Teamwork:** Cooperation between the VR chef and PC waiters is crucial to ensure that each order is completed correctly and on time, providing an exceptional experience to customers.

- **Variety of Burger Options:** From classic burgers to custom creations, players have the freedom to combine ingredients to satisfy unique customer tastes.
